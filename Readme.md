Written using [mootools](http://mootools.net/) and [FancyForm](http://lipidity.com/fancy-form/).

IE history support based on a [jQuery history plugin](http://github.com/tkyk/jquery-history-plugin), originally developed by Taku Sano ([Mikage Sawatari](http://www.mikage.to)), forked by [Takayuki Miwa](http://github.com/tkyk).

Definition layout heavily inspired by Apple's [Dictionary.app](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_%28software%29)
