# Dict.js #
A dict.json interface

## Description ##
Dict.js is an [dict.json](http://github.com/ptrm/dict.json) interface written in javascript.

It supports looking up words from the definition by clicking them, and browsing the definition history (currently doesn't work on IE).

Take a look at the [demo page](http://dict.ptrm.eu/) to find out how it works.
